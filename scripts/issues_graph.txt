stretch colorbar correctly for vibrating string
remove titles from graphs
make time_dep_diff_heatmaps tighter
legend in time_dep_diff_comparison_1 could maybe be made nicer
check that sor_with objects is plotting correctly
consider only using one graph with optimal omega
check if font sizes look good in overleaf
heatmap_primitive_insulation is kinda useless, might delete later
